**Session 2**
Session 2 focused on controlling the speed and direction of a DC motor using pulse-width modulation (PWM) and
        quadrature encoders. We implemented techniques to measure the speed and position of the motor. and  we utilized the step response of the motor to determine the motor's parameters (k and tau) using a
        method called "system identification."
