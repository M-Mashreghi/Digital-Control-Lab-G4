# Digital-Control-Lab-G4


In the third session, we worked on controlling a DC motor using digital techniques. We used an STM32 microcontroller and implemented a digital control algorithm to regulate the motor's speed. The algorithm involved proportional-integral (PI) control with a setpoint of 700 RPM. We calculated the control output based on the error between the setpoint and the actual motor speed, and adjusted the motor's direction and PWM signal accordingly. The control algorithm was executed at a sampling time of 7.62 ms. The code for this session can be found in the main.c file.
